## [MyClippings-Parser](https://github.com/FBoucher/MyClippings-Parser)

As simple as it could be, a .Net Core parser for the Amazon Kindle's `My Clippings.txt" file. The current version support the "Kindle Paperwhite".
Transforming the flat file into an Array JSON Objects. We also added XUnit Test. And it's connected to a public Azure Pipeline available [here](https://dev.azure.com/cloud5mins/MyClippings-Parser) 

The idea is to generate a Docker image from this web API
