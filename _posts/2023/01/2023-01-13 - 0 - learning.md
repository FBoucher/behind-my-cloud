## Summary

For a upcoming refactoring I wanted to create minimal API using .NET 7.0. Then package them in containers and use Dapr to make them communicate between each others. And finally deploy that in Azure Container Apps. But this streams was about the minimal API in container part. And we did it, thanks to the chat!
