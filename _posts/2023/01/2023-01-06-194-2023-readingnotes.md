## Summary

This is the first stream of the year. From a freashly formated stream PC and a few things need adjustment, but not that much. I will spend "a few" minutes to explain the progress done offline and the reason behind some technologycal changes. When we will start coding we will reaalize that a package is depricated and required some refactoring, and learning. There is always something new to learn :) !
