## Summary

My .NET commands were working kinda funky, so we refreash it. Uninstall everything and installed back. Now with a fresh and functional dev enviroment we created a brand new isolated Azure Function using VSCode on Linux and .NET 6.0. Once that was done, it was much easier to see what needed to be done to upgrade the Azure Url Shortener project.
