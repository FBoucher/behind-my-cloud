## Summary

In this stream, we added a new property to the `Url` model to store the date when the URL was created. We also added the column to the grid  so we can sort the URLs by date. Heventhaugh the code all works, we could test it due to a weird issues with Docker. We spent the rest of the stream trying to fix the issue... without success. I tested the code on a different machine and it worked fine. Code is now pushed to the `v-next` branch.
