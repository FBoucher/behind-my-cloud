## Summary

Nice stream this week, live codeing on Note Bookmark. We added the required packages and Aspire CLI to generate the Docker Compose file and bicep files to be able to run the app locally while having the data in Azure. However the security used in this project: ServicePrincipal, was missing. When deployed fully in Azure the AZD manage that for us, but locally something was missing. In a future stream we will look at how to fix that.
