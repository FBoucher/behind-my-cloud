## Summary

This is the luckiest stream in a while, except maybe for @blazormistermagoo who once more didn't land on the target at the parachute game. We started the stream a bit late because of technical issues. We had to investigate why the database was not working in Azure. We found out that an optional binding path value was causing the problem. We found how to set that value using bicep so it can be done automatically during the CICD process. Like I said it was a nice strem where learn a lot! See you next week!
