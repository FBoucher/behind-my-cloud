## Summary

In this stream, we planned for doing some project maintenance reviewing a PR on startrek-demo, than the plan was to do some work on the dotnet-api-apim project. We ended up spending the entire stream on the startrek-demo project. We fixed the database container issue and the connections. The were breaking changes introduced by new version of the libraries. We tested the PR and it was all good after that.
