## Summary

Back to 2D6 Dungeon App project! After looking at the the planner and the current state of the project, we decided to work on moving the doors feature. The problem is that the doors are randomdly positioned and sometimes moving them by 1 or to cells would make more sense. We started working on a new Room Editor dialog that would allow us to move the doors around, but we didn't finish it.
