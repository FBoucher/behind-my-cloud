## Summary

This is a live coding stream where Frank works on his open-source project "NotebookMark," a tool that aggregates reading notes from articles and generates weekly blog posts with AI-powered content suggestions. He discusses his recent setup changes (switching to Arch Linux with Hyprland), shares his experience with various programming languages including starting to learn Go, and works on implementing web search functionality with domain filtering for finding relevant tech blog posts. The stream includes casual conversation with viewers about .NET Conf, streaming tools, learning JavaScript, and his workflow for managing technical reading and note-taking over the past 15+ years.
