## Summary

Frank experiences technical difficulties when his usual OBS setup crashes after moving a PCI Express card, forcing them to switch to his work computer with Mel Studio and dealing with audio/video configuration issues. They spend most of the stream troubleshooting washed-out video colors (potentially HDR/SDR conversion problems with their capture card on Linux/Mac) and audio routing challenges, with help from chat viewers. Despite the setbacks, they briefly discuss their coding project—converting a restaurant finder demo to an event finder using AI—but ultimately decide to end the stream early due to frustration and fatigue.
