## Summary

The plan was really to add a AI feature to the NoteBookmark app, seriously. But we needed to fix some bug where a new post couldn't be added. And it took the entire stream to fix this weird issues. Nevertheless it was a good stream I we (well mostly I) learned a lot about Rider, thanks to the chat and my amazing community. Next stream we will add the AI feature, I promise!
