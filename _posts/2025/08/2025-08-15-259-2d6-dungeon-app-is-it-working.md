## Summary

It's been 3-4 weeks since I last streamed... After changing some hardware the stream setup is repaired and I can stream again! In this stream we chat about my new role at Reka.ai and fix some dependencies in the 2D6 Dungeon App that was preventing the app from running. Feels good to be back!
