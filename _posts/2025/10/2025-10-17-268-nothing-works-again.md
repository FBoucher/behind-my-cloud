## Summary

I had many things to share about things that happened off stream and started by sharing them. Then when we try to start working on the Notebookmark there was issue where .NET seams missing from my computer. We spent the rest of the stream trying to fix that issue with no success. Concidering hos I was feeling inside, I think I managed pretty well to stay calm and not get frustrated.
