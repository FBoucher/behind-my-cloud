## Summary

Frank hosted a live coding stream where he focused on open source maintenance during Hacktoberfest, reviewing and merging pull requests for his Python project "roast my life" (which uses AI to generate humorous commentary on videos). After handling PR reviews, he worked on the Notebookmark project, upgrading it to .NET Aspire 9.5.2 and beginning to implement a new AI-powered feature that will suggest blog posts and articles for users to read based on topics they specify. The stream also included casual chat about music visualization tools, discussion of notification management tools like Octobox and GitKraken Dev, and updates about his recent security event in Toronto.
