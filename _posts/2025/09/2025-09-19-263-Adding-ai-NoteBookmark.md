## Summary

This is a live coding stream where Frank, a developer, works on integrating AI functionality into his project called Notebookmark, a tool he uses to generate weekly blog posts with reading notes and summaries. He's specifically trying to implement an AI feature using the Reka API to automatically generate introduction paragraphs for his blog posts by analyzing the content and categories of articles he's read. The stream shows him setting up the technical infrastructure, including creating a new class library service in his .NET project using JetBrains Rider, though he encounters timeout issues with the API calls that prevent the feature from working by the end of the session.
