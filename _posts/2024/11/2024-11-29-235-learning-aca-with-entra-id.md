## Summary
In this stream we were leaning how to use Microsoft Entra ID with a Blazor App deployed into Azure Container Apps. We created quickly a new blazor App and used VsCode extension to generate a dockerfile for us.  Using Azude Developer CLI (AZD) we were able to quickly deplopy our new app in Azure. Now we had everything to follow the documentation.
