## Summary
Today we started by upgrading the NoteBookmark project to .NET 9 and all the packages to the latest version. Using dotnet-outdated we were able to see all the packages that needed to be updated. We then started to update the packages and fix the issues that came with it. I got some sounds issues but nothing that impacted you. I really need to fix or change this Rode Unify setting, I keep having weird issue since the start.
