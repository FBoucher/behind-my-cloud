## Summary
In this stream, we are working on the creature card component. I'm not a CSS expert, but with patience, I can make it look good. Thanks to @tbdgamer, who raided us with a party of 12, early in the stream. We fanally got the creature card to look good and we are ready to work on a parser or little dice to display numbers.
