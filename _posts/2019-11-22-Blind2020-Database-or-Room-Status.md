# 2019-11-22 - Blind2021 adding Room Status and more

## Summary

In this session, Frank is working on Blind2021, a text-based adventure game written in .Net Core. There two tasks today. 

The first one, add a room status. This way if you take an object in the room or do a particular action the room description will change. 

The second one, add key events that will be "released" so we can aggregate them in a summary.
